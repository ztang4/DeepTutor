"""Mastery scoring policy — intentionally simple and swappable.

``compute_mastery`` maps a knowledge point's attempt history to a 0..1 mastery
score. The current policy is a recency-weighted accuracy with a low-confidence
cap: a single lucky answer cannot "master" a point — mastery is capped until
there is enough evidence.

This is the one place the pedagogy math lives. To plug in a richer model
(e.g. an IRT/BKT estimate or a tuned spec), replace ``compute_mastery`` alone;
callers (`LearningService.calculate_mastery`) need not change.
