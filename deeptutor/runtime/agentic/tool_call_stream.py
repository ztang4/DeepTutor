"""Accumulate OpenAI-compatible streaming tool-call deltas.

Three call sites replay the same provider wire protocol — the chat agent
loop, the explore capability, and the labeled step runner — so the rule for
each field is stated here once instead of being restated per site:

* ``id`` and ``name`` arrive **complete** on whichever delta carries them.
  A provider may repeat them on every subsequent chunk. Assign, never append.
* ``arguments`` arrives as **fragments** that must be concatenated.
* Provider extensions attached to the call arrive **complete** and must be
  preserved. Gemini thinking models put the opaque signature required by the
  next tool round in ``extra_content.google.thought_signature`` (#1181).

Appending a complete field is issue #937: a router that re-sent ``id`` on
every chunk grew it to 47241 characters, far past the 64-character limit the
provider itself enforces, so the round died with HTTP 400 and the user got
the "could not produce a useful response" fallback. The same append also
corrupted ``name`` into ``toolnametoolnametoolname``, which no registry can
resolve — latent for that reporter's gateway, fatal for any gateway that
repeats the name.

The services-layer provider keeps its own accumulator
(``openai_compat_provider._accum_tc``): it already applies these same rules
and reads deltas that may be plain dicts rather than SDK objects, so folding
it in here would widen the blast radius without fixing anything.
