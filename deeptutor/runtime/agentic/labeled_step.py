r"""One streaming LLM call with protocol-label routing.

The core single-round-trip primitive. Given an OpenAI-compatible streaming
client, optional tool schemas, and a label protocol, this:

* Parses the first chunks for a ``\`\`LABEL\`\``` prefix.
* For *non-final* labels (e.g. ``THINK``, ``TOOL``, ``REPLAN``), streams
  post-label text live to ``stream.thinking`` under the supplied
  ``iter_meta`` — i.e. into a reasoning sub-trace.
* For *final* labels (e.g. ``FINISH``, ``PLAN``, ``SUMMARY``), buffers the
  post-label text and returns it to the caller; the caller decides whether
  to emit it as body content (so a mixed ``FINISH+TOOL`` reply never leaks
  prose into the answer area before the protocol is validated).
* Accumulates ``tool_calls`` deltas. Tool-call presence alone does not choose
  the action label: the formal content stream must still begin with the
  caller's tool label (e.g. ``TOOL``), otherwise the caller's protocol repair
  path handles the missing label.
* When a reasoning model prepends a literal ``<think>...</think>`` block
  *before* the protocol label, that prelude is detected and streamed live
  into the reasoning sub-trace (same routing as the ``THINK`` label).
  Label probing resumes on the content after ``</think>``: if the label
  resolves to an intermediate label (e.g. ``THINK``) the post-label text
  continues into the *same* sub-trace; if it resolves to a final label
  (e.g. ``FINISH``) the post-label text routes to the final-response area
  as usual. The ``<think>``/``</think>`` markers themselves are not emitted
  live, only kept in the accumulated buffer so ``clean_thinking_tags`` can
  strip the block from the returned text.

Returns the resolved label, the accumulated post-label text (with provider
``<think>`` tags stripped), and the parsed tool calls.

    ``final_meta`` opts the post-label stream into **live body streaming**:

    is emitted as a :py:meth:`StreamBus.content` event using ``final_meta``

    chunk-by-chunk instead of appearing in one shot at the end. When
