"""Per-kind authorisation for external-provider tools.

One function per provider kind, on purpose. The two kinds do not share an
authorisation rule:

* **MCP** is granted per *tool name* (``grant.mcp_tools``) for deployment
  servers, and by *ownership* for servers a user configured themselves;
* **CLI apps** will be granted per *app id* (``grant.cli_apps``) and are
  installed by an administrator, never self-service.

Collapsing both into one "allowed set" is what makes a CLI app accidentally
governed by an MCP whitelist. Keeping them as two named functions over the
same :class:`~deeptutor.runtime.providers.allowlist.Allowlist` type keeps the
shared plumbing (the deferred-tool manifest, the loader, the session's loaded
names) shared without pretending the policies are one policy.
