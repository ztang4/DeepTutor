"""Resident-memory snapshot of the running DeepTutor process tree.

The counterpart to :mod:`deeptutor.runtime.memory_reclaim`: that module *acts*
on memory (cycle collection, ``malloc_trim``), this one *observes* it so the
settings status strip can show what the app actually costs.

Two things make "how much memory does DeepTutor use" more than one ``getrusage``
call:

* The backend is only one of the processes. ``deeptutor.runtime.launcher``
  spawns the Next.js frontend as a *sibling* (see ``_spawn``), and capabilities
  spawn sandboxes and subagent CLIs below it. Answering honestly means walking
  the supervisor's process tree, which is why the launcher stamps its own pid
  into :data:`SUPERVISOR_PID_ENV` — without that anchor a bare
  ``uvicorn deeptutor.api.main:app`` run would climb into the developer's shell
  and count unrelated jobs.
* Inside a container the host's total RAM is the wrong denominator. cgroup's
  own accounting is what the OOM killer reads, so it wins when present.

Summing per-process RSS double-counts pages shared through ``fork``, so the
total is an upper bound. The cheaper, exact-enough alternative (USS) costs a
page-table walk per process, which is too much for a strip that polls.
