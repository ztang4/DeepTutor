"""Safe extraction of user-uploaded ZIP archives.

A naive ``ZipFile.extractall`` is unsafe for untrusted uploads: it is
vulnerable to *Zip Slip* (path traversal via ``../`` or absolute member
names), *zip bombs* (tiny archives that decompress to fill the disk), and it
happily writes any file type. This module extracts members one at a time and
puts each through the same ``DocumentValidator`` gate as a direct upload:

* member names are collapsed to a sanitized basename, which defuses Zip Slip
  (no path component survives) and enforces the extension whitelist;
* per-entry uncompressed size, cumulative size, entry count and compression
  ratio are all bounded to defeat zip bombs;
* ``__MACOSX`` resource forks, dotfiles, directories and nested archives are
  skipped rather than trusted.

The extractor is deliberately decoupled from the upload router so it can be
unit-tested in isolation and reused by any ingestion path.
