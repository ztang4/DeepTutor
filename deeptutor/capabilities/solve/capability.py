"""Deep Solve capability — problem solving driven by the chat agent loop.

There is no bespoke pipeline anymore. The chat agent loop IS the solver: this
capability marks the turn as solve mode and resolves a session id, then runs
the standard agentic chat pipeline. The solve loop capability
(:class:`deeptutor.capabilities.solve.loop.SolveLoopCapability`) mounts the
solve tools (``solve_plan`` / ``solve_finish_step`` / ``solve_replan``) plus a
curated built-in toolset
(``rag`` / ``code_execution`` / ``geogebra_analysis`` / …) and injects the
solver playbook; the in-memory :class:`SolveSession` holds the plan, the
per-step gate, and the replan budget.

Design axiom (shared with chat / mastery): the intelligence lives at the
loop's exit — the model plans and solves — while the deterministic spine
(commit to a plan, don't skip steps, bounded replan) is engine state read and
written through tools.
