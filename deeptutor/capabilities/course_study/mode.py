"""Course Study mode — the standard chat loop acting as a course orchestrator.

There is no bespoke pipeline: as with immersive reading, the selected composer
mode only normalizes turn metadata and starts :class:`AgenticChatPipeline`.
Course-specific tools, prompt policy, and the bounded pre-loop state summary are
contributed by
:class:`~deeptutor.capabilities.course_study.capability.CourseStudyLoopCapability`.

The split is especially important here. The mode must keep ordinary chat tools
available so it can investigate a concrete learner request, while its prompt
enforces the narrower product role: recommend the next learning action and hand
off; never teach the course material itself.

With no course bound the loop capability remains strictly inactive, so its
tools cannot leak. The mode places the dedicated ``no_course`` variant in the
ordinary prompt context before starting the loop; that variant forbids invented
course state and asks the learner to attach a course.
