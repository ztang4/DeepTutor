"""Explore-context loop capability.

A near-invisible loop capability that activates whenever the chat turn carries
any readable (non-image) attached source — a document, a notebook record, a
book section, a question-bank entry, or — the motivating case — a referenced
conversation history. When active it runs a read-only pre-pass
(:class:`ContextExplorer`) *before* the answer loop's first LLM call: an
agentic investigation that uses ``read_source`` to read the attached sources
the user's request actually needs, then folds an objective, third-person
investigation into the loop's user-message seed.

Why it exists:

* The chat loop fuses "understand the attached material" with "answer the
  user" in a single loop. When the material is a transcript of the user
  talking to another AI agent, the model reads those ``## Assistant`` turns in
  the same context it answers from and adopts that agent's first-person voice.
  Separating comprehension into an objective pre-pass removes that confusion
  structurally.
* Weak models under native tool calling routinely never call ``read_source``
  themselves. Owning source-reading in a dedicated pre-pass — and dropping the
  tool from the answer loop entirely — forces the investigation to happen up
  front instead of being skipped.

The capability owns no answer-loop tools and contributes no system block — it
works purely through the optional async ``pre_loop`` hook (see
:class:`LoopExtension`). ``read_source`` lives inside the pre-pass's own tool
loop, not on the answer loop's surface.
