"""Mastery Path tools — the seam between the chat-loop tutor and the pure
mastery engine (:mod:`deeptutor.learning`).

These tools are auto-mounted only when a mastery path is active on the
turn (via the chat loop mastery capability). The chat agent loop IS the tutor;
these tools let it read the gate and record outcomes, while the pedagogy —
what to teach, how to question, when to explain — stays the model's job. The
arithmetic (mastery, gate, spaced repetition) stays in the engine.

The active path id is injected server-side by the pipeline as
``_mastery_path_id``; the model never supplies it. Each call constructs a
fresh store + service (matching the REST router) so concurrent turns can't
race on a shared object.
