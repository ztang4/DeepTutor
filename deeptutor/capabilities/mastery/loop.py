"""Mastery path loop-capability hooks.

The pause/resume hooks commit against **the path's one open interaction**, not
against the question id printed on the ``ask_user`` card. The engine allows a
single open question per path, so that interaction is unambiguous — while the
card's id is only as trustworthy as the round it was built in: a model may emit
``mastery_quiz`` and ``ask_user`` in the *same* round, and every tool call in a
round has its arguments bound before any of them runs. In that case nothing is
persisted yet when ``ask_user`` is bound, so the card keeps the model's own id
and ``_bind_pending_ask_user_args`` has nothing to rebind it to. Treating that
id as authoritative used to abort the whole turn on a mismatch.
