"""Mastery Path capability — mastery-based tutoring driven by the chat loop.

There is no bespoke state machine here anymore. The chat agent loop IS the
tutor: this capability only marks the turn as mastery mode and resolves the
*initial* active path id, then runs the standard agentic chat pipeline. The
pipeline mounts the mastery tools — the gate tools (``mastery_status`` /
``mastery_quiz`` / ``mastery_grade`` / ``mastery_skip_question`` /
``mastery_assess`` / ``mastery_build``) and the binding tools
(``mastery_paths`` / ``mastery_switch`` / ``mastery_leave``), through which
the tutor can move the conversation between paths mid-turn — and injects the
tutor playbook; the pure engine in
:mod:`deeptutor.learning` owns the hard, per-type mastery gate and the
spaced-repetition arithmetic.

Design axiom (shared with chat): the intelligence lives at the loop's exit —
the model decides what to teach and how to question — while the gate that
decides *whether the learner may advance* is a deterministic engine call.
