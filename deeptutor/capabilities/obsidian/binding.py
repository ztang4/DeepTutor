"""Resolve which connected Obsidian vault (if any) the current turn targets.

The binding is derived once per turn from the user's selected knowledge bases:
the first selection whose KB metadata is ``type == obsidian`` wins, and its
``vault_path`` becomes the live vault the Obsidian tools operate on. The result
is cached in the extension namespace so ``is_active`` / ``augment_kwargs`` /
``system_block`` share a single filesystem lookup. Pure read — no audit
side-effects (unlike ``resolve_for_rag``), and access errors resolve to "no
vault" rather than raising.
