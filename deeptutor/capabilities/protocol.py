class LoopExtension(Protocol):
    """Optional per-turn extension point for the chat agent loop.

    A loop capability reuses the *full* chat tool surface — every built-in,
    with the user's composer toggles respected exactly as in plain chat — and
    adds its own :attr:`owned_tools` on top when active. It does not curate or
    suppress the reused surface: a solve / mastery turn sees the same built-ins
    a chat turn would, plus the capability's own tools.

    The exception is the *knowledge* category (:class:`KnowledgeCapability`),
    which sets :attr:`exclusive_tools` and replaces the surface instead of
    augmenting it. Plain capabilities leave the attribute absent (read with a
    ``getattr(cap, "exclusive_tools", False)`` default) so this default — and
    the augment-don't-suppress invariant above — stays true for them.

    Optional async ``pre_loop`` hook
    --------------------------------
    A capability MAY define::

        async def pre_loop(
            self, context, stream, *, usage=None
        ) -> PromptBlock | None: ...

    which the chat pipeline awaits **once, before the answer loop's first LLM
    call**, when the capability is active. Its returned block is folded into
    the loop's user-message seed (alongside the KB seed) so the answer loop
    treats it as grounding context for the turn. Use it for a bounded
    pre-pass that produces context the loop should have up front — e.g.
    :class:`~deeptutor.capabilities.explore_context.ExploreContextCapability`
    briefs the turn's attached sources objectively before the model answers.

    This hook is **optional** and not part of the required structural surface:
    the pipeline reads it with a ``getattr(cap, "pre_loop", None)`` default
    (mirroring :attr:`exclusive_tools`), so plain capabilities that omit it are
    unaffected. ``usage`` is the turn's token tracker, passed so a pre-pass can
    fold its own LLM cost into the turn total.

    Capabilities that own a durable user interaction MAY also define async
    ``on_user_pause(context, ask_user)`` and ``on_user_resume(context,
    ask_user, *, reply_text, answers)`` hooks.  The pipeline invokes them on
    the two sides of an ``ask_user`` wait so state can be committed before a
    disconnect or another LLM round.

    A capability whose tools can repoint the turn at a different target MAY
    declare those tool names as ``rebinding_tools: tuple[str, ...]`` (read with
    a ``getattr`` default, like ``pre_loop``). The dispatcher runs them before
    the round's other calls and re-binds those calls afterwards, so a switch
    and a write issued in the same round cannot land on different targets.

    A capability MAY also define ``finish_instruction(context, final_text)``.
    It is called after a tool-less LLM round and may return a short protocol
    instruction when that round must not finalize the turn. The answer loop
    gives the model one additional round with tools still mounted; capability
    implementations are responsible for keeping the check narrow and bounded.

    A finish-guard capability whose private decision may share a round with a
    tool call MAY additionally define ``tool_round_output_policy(context,
    final_text, tool_names)`` (``"publish"`` / ``"discard"``) and
    ``final_text_override(context, final_text)``. These hooks let it preserve a
    previously accepted public answer while keeping protocol-only prose private.
