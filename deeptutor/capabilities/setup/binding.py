"""Decide whether a turn is a setup turn, and what is missing from the install.

Two questions live here.

**What is missing** (:func:`setup_gaps`) reads the same spec rows the tools
write, so "what would I offer to fix" and "what can I change" can never drift
apart. A gap is only reported when it costs the user a capability they would
otherwise expect — no embedding model means knowledge bases cannot be built, a
text-only parser means PDFs lose their tables — never as a nag about taste
(nobody needs to be told their theme is the default one).

**Whether to take part** (:func:`is_setup_turn`) deliberately does not ask the
model to sniff intent. An implicitly-mounted capability that activates whenever
an LLM *feels* configuration might be relevant is the failure mode that makes
such a feature obnoxious: it surfaces in unrelated conversations, and the tools
it mounts distract from what was actually asked. Activation here needs one of
three objective signals — the user picked the capability, the message pairs an
action word with a configuration object, or this is the user's first
conversation on an install that still has a real gap (once, ever).

Everything is cached in a namespaced extension state so the hooks that run per
turn share one filesystem pass, matching how the other capabilities bind.

    earlier version marked it spent from ``system_block``, which meant the first
    time a user asked for anything at all ("change the theme") the offer was
    silently consumed and a genuinely unconfigured install was never proactively
    helped. ``intro`` also earns an extra prompt note, since opening a
    conversation the user did not start on this subject calls for a different
    tone than answering a direct request.

    The check order matters: the two cheap signals are evaluated before
    ``_intro_pending``, which reads settings and computes the install's gaps.
