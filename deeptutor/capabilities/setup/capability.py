"""Setup loop capability — DeepTutor configuring its own install.

A *plain* :class:`~deeptutor.capabilities.protocol.LoopExtension`, not a
:class:`~deeptutor.capabilities.protocol.KnowledgeCapability`: configuring the
app is something the user asks for in the middle of ordinary work ("switch to
Chinese and use a better PDF parser"), so the turn keeps its normal tool
surface — knowledge bases, web search, the lot — and these four tools are added
on top. An exclusive capability would strip exactly the abilities a
configuration conversation is often about.

Activation is decided by :func:`~deeptutor.capabilities.setup.binding.is_setup_turn`
on objective signals rather than by the model's sense of relevance; see that
module for why.

The system block carries the install's current gaps. That is what lets the
model open with something useful ("your knowledge bases can't be built yet —
no embedding model is selected") instead of a menu, and it costs one filesystem
pass that ``is_active`` has already paid for.
