"""Long-running setup work: installing a parsing engine, fetching its weights.

Both jobs already exist as background subprocess managers with a cursor-based
line log — the settings page starts one and polls it. This module wraps them so
the *chat* surface can run the same job differently: start it, then follow the
log to completion inside a single tool call, relaying each new line through the
turn's event sink.

That shape is chosen for the user, not for convenience. A model that had to
poll would burn one LLM round-trip per check, so progress would arrive in
lurches between silences, and a ten-minute model download would cost a dozen
paid turns. Following the log inside one call gives a live feed for the price
of one.

What may be run is fixed by the same allow-lists the HTTP endpoints use
(``ENGINE_PIP_SPECS``, ``ENGINE_MODEL_DOWNLOADERS``, MinerU's own resolver).
The model supplies an engine id, never a package name or a command, so no
prompt — or anything an attacker managed to get into one — can turn this into
arbitrary installation.
