"""Resolve which connected Tencent IMA libraries the current turn can reach.

The binding is derived once per turn from the user's selected knowledge bases:
every selection whose KB metadata is ``type == ima`` becomes a library the IMA
tools may operate on. Unlike the Obsidian binding (one live vault per turn) all
selected IMA libraries are kept, because a turn can legitimately browse one and
read from another — the tools take an explicit ``kb_name`` when there is more
than one.

Credentials are deliberately *not* part of a binding. What a tool call carries is
the KB reference; the credential pair is loaded from ``kb_config.json`` at call
time by :func:`resolve_client`, which also re-runs the per-user access check. So
no secret is ever placed in tool kwargs (where a trace or a log could pick it up),
and a model cannot reach a library by naming one that was not selected.
