"""IMA loop capability — inventory, source reading and authoring over a live library.

Active whenever one of the turn's selected knowledge bases is a connected Tencent
IMA library (resolved by :mod:`deeptutor.capabilities.ima.binding`).

Unlike the Obsidian and subagent capabilities this is a *plain*
:class:`~deeptutor.capabilities.protocol.LoopExtension`, not a
:class:`~deeptutor.capabilities.protocol.KnowledgeCapability`: it **adds** its
tools to chat's normal surface instead of replacing it. That difference is not
stylistic — it follows from what the KB actually is. An Obsidian vault has no
index at all, so ``rag`` is useless against it and the capability must own the
turn. An IMA library is genuinely searchable over HTTP: the ``ima`` RAG provider
answers ``rag`` calls for it. Retrieval therefore stays where it belongs, and
these tools add only what retrieval cannot do — enumerate the library, read a
whole source, search notes by recency, and write back.

Keeping the surface additive also means a turn that attaches an IMA library
alongside other knowledge bases (or that needs web search) does not lose those
abilities, which an exclusive capability would strip.
