"""
Book event hub
==============

One long-lived event stream **per book**, owned by the process rather than by
whichever request happened to start the work.

Why this exists
---------------

The Book Engine's unit of work is a *book*, not a request: ``confirm_spine``
returns as soon as the page shells exist, while the compilation it queued keeps
running for minutes afterwards. A bus that is created per request and closed in
the router's ``finally`` therefore drops every background event on the floor —
``StreamBus.emit()`` silently no-ops once the bus is closed, so the whole
"watch your book being written" experience degrades into a frozen page.

The hub inverts the ownership:

- **Producers** (engine, compiler, background worker) publish into
  ``get_book_bus(book_id)``. They never create or close a bus.
- **Consumers** (WebSocket clients) subscribe to that same bus and may come and
  go freely. ``StreamBus.subscribe()`` replays recent history, so a client that
  reconnects mid-compilation catches up instead of waiting for the next event.
- A bus is closed exactly once — when the book is deleted.

Because REST handlers publish into the same place as WebSocket handlers, a book
compiled via REST still streams to anyone watching over WebSocket.
