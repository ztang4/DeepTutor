"""Per-user tool and exec access resolution (grant v2).

Optional built-in tools keep the partner config semantics for real users:
``None`` means "unrestricted / follow defaults", a set is an explicit
whitelist. MCP tools are different because they can proxy host-side
capabilities through configured MCP servers. For non-admin real users an
absent MCP grant is therefore deny-by-default; administrators remain
unrestricted. Synthetic scopes (partners) are handled by the chat pipeline,
where their owner-scoped whitelist travels through context metadata
(``mcp_tools_filter`` / ``enabled_tools``).

Enforcement points:

* ``allowed_optional_tools`` — turn_runtime filters every turn's ``tools``
  payload (single choke point for all capabilities), and the tools router
  filters the /settings/tools listing so the UI matches.
* ``allowed_mcp_tools`` — the chat pipeline intersects this with any
  caller-scoped ``mcp_tools_filter`` before building the deferred-tool
  loader, so a granted-away MCP tool can be neither listed nor loaded. For
  real non-admin users, missing ``mcp_tools`` means no MCP tools are listed
  or loadable until an admin grants specific names.
* ``allowed_cli_apps`` — the provider that turns installed CLI apps into
  deferred tools intersects this with the account's own enable/disable
  preference. Same deny-by-default posture as MCP, for the same reason: an
  installed app runs third-party code inside the sandbox.
* ``exec_override`` — layered on top of the deployment exec policy in the
  chat pipeline's exec gate and in the exec tool itself.
