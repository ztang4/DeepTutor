"""Shared plumbing for capability ``run()`` endpoints.

Capabilities all converge on the same final emission:

    await stream.result({"response": ..., ...}, source="<cap>")

The basic chat capability also attaches a per-turn ``cost_summary`` so the
frontend can render ``$cost · tokens · calls`` in its message footer.
Several other capabilities used to duplicate that merge inline (solve,
research, question followup) and the rest skipped it entirely (visualize,
math_animator), so the footer only appeared for some
capabilities. This module centralizes the merge + emit so every capability
emits the same envelope shape.
