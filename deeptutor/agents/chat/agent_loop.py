"""Single-loop chat agent.

One chat turn = ONE agent loop over a single growing conversation:

* each round is one LLM call; its text streams to the user as a ``content``
  block, and its tool calls are dispatched with their ``role=tool`` results
  appended back into the conversation;
* a round that DOES call tools is "narration" by default — its text is a
  preamble to the tool work — and the loop continues; modes that intentionally
  combine learner-facing prose with a tool call mark that prose answer-visible;
* a round that calls NO tools is the ``finish``: its text IS the final
  user-facing answer and the loop ends (the model deciding it is done; a
  first round without tool calls is the "no exploration needed" fast path);
* if the exploration budget runs out while work is still in protocol, a
  small bounded settlement phase keeps tools available for already-started
  follow-up (including user input); one final tool-less round is forced only
  after that settlement allowance is exhausted.

``ask_user`` pauses the turn for a reply and resumes in-protocol; an
unresolved pause (or a terminator tool) halts the turn.

There is no separate respond pass and no text destination has to be guessed
mid-stream: every round's text streams to the user as it is generated, and a
``call_role`` (``narration`` vs ``finish``) emitted when the round completes
tells the frontend how to render that round's text.
