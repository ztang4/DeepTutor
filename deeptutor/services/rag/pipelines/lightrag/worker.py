"""Event-loop isolation helpers for local LightRAG indexing.

LightRAG's local storage backends perform synchronous graph merging and
JSON serialization from inside async methods.  Running those methods on the
service event loop therefore stalls unrelated API and LLM work.  This module
provides one narrow boundary: run the indexing coroutine on a worker thread's
private event loop, while explicitly forwarding network I/O and callbacks to
the event loop that owns the request.
