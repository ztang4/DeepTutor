"""Probe a Tencent IMA knowledge base before connecting a KB to it.

Connecting is cheap and reversible, but wrong credentials or a mistyped
knowledge base id should fail loudly at connect time rather than silently at
every later query. One ``get_knowledge_base`` round-trip answers both questions
the UI needs to confirm: are the credentials accepted, and does the id resolve to
a library we can name back to the user?

Always returns an :class:`ImaProbe` (never raises); ``ok`` is the single boolean
the caller gates on, with ``error`` explaining any failure.
