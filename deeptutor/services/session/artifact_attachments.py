"""Generated-file attachments carried by a turn's stream events.

The ``exec`` / ``code_execution`` / media tools write files into the turn
workspace and publish them in two places: each ``tool_result`` event carries
them in ``metadata.tool_metadata.artifacts`` the moment the tool finishes (the
source that survives cancelled turns), and the loop's final SOURCES event
aggregates them as ``type=="artifact"`` sources. Both are read — the caller
dedupes by URL.

Persisting them as assistant-message attachments is what lets the chat UI
render openable cards (same Viewer path as user uploads) and list them in the
session activity panel, instead of relying on the model pasting a raw
``/files/outputs`` URL into its answer.
