    Inject image attachments into the last user message (Stage 1).

    Images are injected **optimistically for every provider/model** — this
    function does not consult ``supports_vision``. A model that natively
    understands images therefore always receives them, even one DeepTutor has
    no capability entry for (the original Doubao/VolcEngine bug). When a model
    genuinely cannot handle images the request fails and the Stage-2 fallback
    (:func:`should_degrade_to_text` + :func:`strip_image_parts`, applied at
    each call site's retry seam) strips the images and retries as text-only.

    The last user message ``content`` is converted from a plain string into a
    content-parts array holding the original text plus the image(s). The only
    images dropped *here* are url-only attachments the provider can't accept in
    URL form (Anthropic, or ``vision_url_supported=False``) and that can't be
    resolved to local bytes — counted in ``url_images_dropped``.

    Args:
        messages: The OpenAI-style messages list (may be mutated).
        attachments: ``Attachment`` objects from ``UnifiedContext``.
        binding: Provider binding (``"openai"``, ``"anthropic"``, …).
