"""OAuth 2.1 for MCP servers that require it.

Most hosted MCP servers moved to OAuth: Notion, Linear, Sentry, Asana, monday,
Canva and Prisma all answer an unauthenticated request with ``401``. A store that
only knows how to put a static API key in a header cannot offer any of them, so
this module adds the missing half.

The protocol work is the MCP SDK's — :class:`mcp.client.auth.OAuthClientProvider`
does discovery (RFC 9728 → RFC 8414), dynamic client registration (RFC 7591),
authorization-code + PKCE, and refresh. It is an ``httpx.Auth``, so it attaches
to the client each transport already builds and no transport shape changes. What
this module owns is the three things the SDK delegates:

**Where the tokens live.** Per ``(owner, server)`` under the owner's secrets
tree — the one branch of ``data/`` the exec sandbox never mounts. A refresh token
authorises *a person's* account on a third-party service; anything a sandboxed
shell can read is, in a multi-account deployment, readable by every account. The
sibling module :mod:`deeptutor.services.mcp.secrets` holds static credentials in
the same tree for the same reason.

**Who may start a flow.** Only an explicit user action. A background reconnect
has no human in front of it, so it must never block on a consent screen: the
non-interactive path raises :class:`AuthorizationRequired` the moment the SDK
asks to redirect, and the server's status becomes ``needs_auth`` so the UI can
offer a Connect button instead of retrying forever.

**What we tell the provider about ourselves.** One client registration per
``(owner, server)``, stored beside the tokens. Registrations are not shared
across accounts: a client id issued for one person's consent must not become the
identity another person's consent is recorded against.
