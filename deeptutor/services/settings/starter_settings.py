"""Starter-suggestion settings.

One knob, stored per user in ``data/user/settings/starters.json``: how many
recent activities the model is shown when it proposes what to explore next.

Per user rather than deployment-wide because it tunes a reading of *this*
learner's own memory, and because it costs nothing on the server — it changes
the size of one prompt, not the resources anyone else can claim.
