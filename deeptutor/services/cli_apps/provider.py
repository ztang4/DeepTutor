"""Installed CLI apps, presented to a chat turn as deferred tools.

One tool per app, named ``cli_<app id>``. The tool takes an **argument vector**
rather than a command line, so the model composes ``["scene", "list"]`` and never
a string that something downstream has to parse.

Progressive disclosure does the heavy lifting for prompt cost: the manifest
carries one line per app (its catalog description), and only when the model calls
``load_tools`` does the app's own usage guide reach the schema. That guide is read
from the *installed* package at that moment — not vendored, not fetched — and
sanitised on the way in, since it is third-party text landing in a schema.

Authorisation is resolved here rather than by the MCP allowlist, because the two
key on different things: an MCP grant lists **tool names**, a CLI grant lists
**app ids**. :func:`authorized_apps` is the whole policy, in one place.
