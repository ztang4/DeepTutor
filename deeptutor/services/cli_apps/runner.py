"""Execute one installed CLI app, through the sandbox.

Arguments come from the model, so they are passed as an **argument vector** and
never as a shell string: :meth:`ExecRequest.of_argv` derives the shell form for
older runner images, and every backend that understands ``argv`` execs it
directly. That is the whole reason ``argv`` exists — an app invocation is the one
exec path in DeepTutor whose arguments are model-authored *and* whose program is
fixed, so there is nothing to gain from a shell and a lot to lose.

The app's own ``bin`` directory goes on ``PATH`` and nothing else does: a Python
harness shells out to its own interpreter and its own console scripts, and it
must find those rather than whatever the sandbox image happens to ship.
