"""Materialize image attachments to files so a subagent CLI can ingest them.

When ``forward_images`` is on for a backend, the consult tool writes the turn's
image attachments to a temp directory and hands the backend their paths — Codex
attaches them with ``-i``, Claude Code is pointed at them for its Read tool. The
bytes come from the attachment's inline base64 or, failing that, the local
:class:`AttachmentStore`; external URLs are never fetched (sync network IO in an
async path, and a request-forgery footgun).
