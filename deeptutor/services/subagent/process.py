"""Stream a child process's stdout/stderr line-by-line as it runs.

The single low-level primitive the subagent backends share: spawn a command and
yield every stdout and stderr line the moment it arrives — so a long, multi-step
agent run surfaces live in the sidebar instead of all at once at the end — then
guarantee the process is torn down when the consumer stops early or the turn is
cancelled.

There is deliberately **no timeout** on the wait: per the product contract,
DeepTutor waits unconditionally for the subagent's own logic to finish; only the
subagent exiting (cleanly or with an error) ends the stream. Cancellation (the
user aborting the turn) propagates as ``CancelledError`` and the ``finally``
block terminates the child so no orphaned agent process is left behind.

    On Windows, ``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`` (and the underlying

    name, so CLIs installed by npm ship as ``.cmd``/``.bat``/``.ps1`` shims
    (e.g. ``claude``/``codex``) are invisible and the spawn raises
    ``FileNotFoundError`` — the backend then reports "not installed" even
    though the CLI is on PATH. ``shutil.which`` honors ``PATHEXT`` (and a
    caller-supplied PATH) and returns the shim's full path, so the spawn
    finds it.

    Returns the command unchanged when ``cmd`` is empty, when ``cmd[0]`` is
    already an absolute path (resolved back to itself), or when nothing on
    PATH matches — in that last case the OS spawn behaves exactly as before,
    preserving the existing ``FileNotFoundError`` semantics callers handle.
