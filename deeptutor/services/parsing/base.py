Parsing is deliberately kept OFF the ``RAGPipeline`` protocol
(``services/rag/pipelines/base.py``): it is an upstream, shared, *optional*
stage. An engine turns bytes/path into a :class:`~deeptutor.services.parsing.types.ParsedDocument`
and declares its availability + model readiness so the UI can gate local model
downloads (default: no silent multi-GB pull).
