"""Cut a source file into addressable units (the locator space).

One job, no I/O beyond reading the source: given a path, return the unit texts
plus what a unit *is* for that format. Everything else in the reading engine
consumes :class:`Extraction` and never looks at the original bytes again —
which is what keeps store, search, outline and export format-agnostic.

Per-format strategy, and why:

* **PDF** — PyMuPDF, one unit per physical page. Done here rather than through
  the shared text extractor because that one joins the pages into a single
  string; we need them apart. Physical pages are also the only unit that lines
  up with what the reader renders, so PDFs are the one format with a faithful
  raw view.
* **PPTX** — the shared extractor already emits ``--- Slide N ---`` separators,
  so we split on those instead of re-implementing python-pptx handling.
* **everything else** (EPUB, DOCX, XLSX, TXT, MD, code, …) — the shared
  extractor's plain text, cut into fixed-size *sections* on paragraph
  boundaries.

The last bullet is a deliberate trade-off for EPUB: chapter-accurate cutting
would mean reaching into the extractor's private per-chapter helpers, coupling
this module to their internals. Since a non-PDF material is read from extracted
text anyway (no faithful raw view), a section is nearly as good a handle as a
chapter, and the seam stays clean. Chapter cutting can be added later as one
more branch here without touching a single consumer.
