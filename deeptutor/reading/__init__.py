"""Immersive reading engine — materials, locators, annotations, export.

A *material* is a file the user reads: it is cut once into **units** and stored
per-unit, so every later operation addresses it by **locator** (a 1-indexed unit
number that means page / chapter / slide / section depending on the format).
That one abstraction is what lets a model cite "page 12" and the reader scroll
to page 12 without either side knowing the file is a PDF.

Layering, bottom-up — each layer depends only on the ones above it in this list:

* :mod:`.models` — dataclasses and errors. No I/O, no imports from siblings.
* :mod:`.extract` — file → units. The only module that knows about formats.
* :mod:`.search` — pure locator-addressed matching over ``(locator, text)``.
* :mod:`.store` — durable per-material layout, atomic writes, annotations.
* :mod:`.service` — the composition callers use (read / search / outline /
  quote verification).
* :mod:`.export` — the annotated artefacts a user can take away.

Nothing here imports the chat loop, the tool registry or FastAPI, so the engine
is testable on its own and the capability that drives it
(:mod:`deeptutor.capabilities.reading`) stays a thin shell.
