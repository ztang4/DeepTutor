"""
CLI apps API
============

Mounted at ``/api/space/cli-apps``. Two audiences on one surface, split by
method rather than by route prefix so the page has one thing to read:

* **anyone signed in** — ``GET /apps`` (what is installed, and whether I may use
  it), ``GET /catalog`` (what exists), ``PUT /apps/{id}/enabled`` (my own
  preference among the apps I have been granted);
* **administrators only** — ``POST /catalog/{id}/install`` and
  ``DELETE /apps/{id}``.

The admin routes are gated individually with ``Depends(require_admin)`` rather
than by an all-router dependency, because installing is the privileged half and
reading is not: installing runs a third-party ``setup.py`` in the application
container, as the application user. That is the whole reason CLI apps are not
self-service, and it is why an ordinary account's verb here is *enable*.

Enabling is a preference, not a permission. The permission is
``grant.cli_apps``, resolved server-side in ``cli_apps.provider``; an account can
only switch off something it was granted, never switch on something it was not.
