"""
Per-user MCP API
================

The servers an individual configures for themselves, mounted at
``/api/space/mcp``. Auth-gated, **not** admin-gated: this is the whole point
of the surface — a learner adds the hosted services they use without an
administrator in the loop.

What keeps that safe is narrow rather than trusting:

* **remote transports only** — a ``stdio`` server is a command run on the host
  as the app user, so it stays in the admin registry
  (``/api/settings/mcp``) permanently;
* **credentials are stored apart from the config** and never returned; a field
  reports only whether it is configured;
* **every write is scoped to the caller's own file** — the owner is resolved
  server-side and is never accepted from the request.

Deployment servers stay visible here read-only, so "which tools do I have?" has
one answer instead of two.
