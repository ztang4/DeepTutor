"""End-to-end cover for the book WebSocket protocol.

The bug this protects against was invisible to unit tests: the router created a
bus per action and closed it in ``finally``, so every event emitted by work that
outlived the action — i.e. all background compilation — was dropped on the
floor. Both halves have to be checked through the real socket:

1. a subscriber receives events published after any action has returned, and
2. finishing an action does not close the book's stream out from under it.
