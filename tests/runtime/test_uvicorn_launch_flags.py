"""Guards that every uvicorn launch point wires the shared serving flags.

The browser never reaches the backend directly: ``web/proxy.ts`` rewrites
``/api/*`` and Next.js forwards over Node's ``http.globalAgent``, which reaps
idle pooled sockets on its own 5s timer. uvicorn's ``timeout_keep_alive``
defaults to the same 5s, so both ends armed an identical idle timer on the same
socket and raced to close it; a FIN landing on a socket the pool was handing to
a new request killed it with ``ECONNRESET``, which the proxy turned into a 500
("Failed to proxy ... socket hang up" -> "Failed to load sessions" in the UI).
``--timeout-keep-alive`` fixes it, and ``--ws-max-size`` has the same shape:
correct only if *every* launch point passes it, and DeepTutor has five (two
Dockerfile stages, the ``deeptutor start`` launcher, the CLI, run_server). A
launch point that forgets one reintroduces the bug for whoever starts the
backend that way, which no per-module test would catch.
