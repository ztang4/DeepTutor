"""The hand-off's trip through the real dispatcher.

Everything else about Course Study is tested against the tools directly. This
file covers the one seam those tests cannot see: what the *frontend* actually
receives. A tool's own ``ToolResult.metadata`` does not arrive at the top level
of a stream event — the dispatcher nests it under ``tool_metadata`` — and the
card reader in ``web/lib/course-handoff.ts`` reads exactly that path. Reading
the top level instead type-checks fine and silently finds nothing, which is why
the contract is pinned here rather than trusted.
