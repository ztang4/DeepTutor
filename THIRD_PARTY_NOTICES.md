## thinking-orbs

- Project: [Jakubantalik/Libraries](https://github.com/Jakubantalik/Libraries) (`packages/thinking-orbs`)
- Source commit: `3862ffa345217443b63696a8c331a0664eea4b04`
- License: MIT
- Copyright: Copyright (c) 2026 Jakub Antalik
- Vendored files: `web/vendor/thinking-orbs/`

DeepTutor vendors this package's source rather than depending on the published
`thinking-orbs` npm package, so the dotted thought-orbs can take the host row's
`currentColor` instead of a flat greyscale ramp. Those local changes are listed at the top of
`web/vendor/thinking-orbs/index.ts` and marked at each site. Everything else is
upstream's, unmodified. The MIT license text from that source commit follows:
