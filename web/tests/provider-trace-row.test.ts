/**
 * The wiring between what a turn actually emits and what the activity row shows.
 *
 * The fixture is not hand-written: it is the trace metadata recorded from real
 * LLM turns against a real MCP server (Wolfram) and a real installed CLI app
 * (mermaid), trimmed to the fields the row reads. That matters, because the first
 * attempt at verifying this in the browser produced a *false negative* — a
 * long-lived dev backend was serving code from before the change — and a fixture
 * copied from the real wire is the thing that keeps this honest without a server.
