/**
 * Turn-level timing for the chat status header.
 *
 * Each assistant turn used to surface a duration label on every
 * sub-trace ("Plan for 5s", "Round 3 · 8s", …). That made the
 * trace card noisy and made it hard to tell at a glance how long
 * the whole answer took. The current design hoists timing to the
 * single ``DeepTutor reasoning…`` status row at the top of the
 * answer: one number, ticking up while the turn is in flight and
 * frozen once the turn is done.
 *
 * The clock derives its bounds from the event stream so reconnects
 * keep the duration coherent — we never depend on a transient React
 * state that resets on remount.

 * While ``isStreaming`` is true the upper bound floats to
 * ``nowSeconds`` so the label ticks up in real time; once streaming
 * ends the bound collapses to the latest event timestamp and the
