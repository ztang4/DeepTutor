/**
 * Bridge from a reading tool's result to the reader pane.
 *
 * The reading tools signal UI intent on their `ToolResult.metadata` under
 * `reader_action` — `goto` to move the view, `annotate` to surface a mark the
 * assistant just made, or `switch_tab` to bind the workspace to another source.
 * The chat forwards that as a DOM event and the reader pane
 * listens; neither side imports the other, so the chat needs no knowledge of the
 * reader and vice versa (the same seam the visualize-prompt bridge uses).
 *
 * The extraction is defensive because the metadata crosses the wire: anything
 * unrecognised is dropped rather than dispatched.
